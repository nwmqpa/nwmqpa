## About Me

I'm Thomas, a french IT student at Epitech, a freelance free for hire and the principal CoFounder of Nebulis.

I go by the username `nwmqpa` on most platforms, including this one, and my internet presence predates the official release of Minecraft.

I started coding by tinkering with the above mentionned game, same goes for my Sysadmin skills.

Nowadays, I'm interested in a variety of subjects, ranging from AI to Cloud Architecture. 

## Epitech

As a student at Epitech, but also a teaching assistant, I've honed my coding skills in a variety of languages and frameworks, making me able to take on about any projects, with some needing a bit of a startup time.

From school projects, I'm competent in:

* C

* Python
* Haskell
* NodeJS
* Typescript

By my own interests, I'm competent in:

* Docker
* Rust
* Java
* Lua
* Go
* AWS
* GCP
* Flutter


I've also been able, due to my teaching assistant role, to provide insights and knowledge in an actionnable wayto students in a project-based pedagogy.

## Freelance

As stated above, I'm free for hire in a variety of subjects, and in the languages stated before.

If the language/framework you are interested in hiring me for isn't listed, feel free to contact me either way, as I didn't listed a lot as to not supercharge this profile.

Here is my (malt profile)[https://www.malt.fr/profile/thomasnicollet1] with the recommandations from several clients.
